## Reporting a Vulnerability

It should be noted that cyber-ctf-ema-server is a vulnerable software. As a result, it is vulnerable by default. Although, if you find any vulnerability that is not planned (not an intent vulnerability) in [CTF - Ema Server](https://github.com/AmeDigital/cyber-ctf-ema-app), don't hesitate to _report them_.

1. Use any of the [security@amedigital.com](https://www.amedigital.com/.well-known/security.txt) with PGP Encryption.
2. Describe the vulnerability.

   If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

3. We will evaluate the vulnerability and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps to address it. We will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

   Please **do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until a fix is released!

4. Once we have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to publicly disclose it.
